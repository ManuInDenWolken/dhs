### What is dhs?
With dhs (Dependency Hook Services) you can set dependencies as optional or
necessary for your project. You can define abstract dependent services with
ability to decide which service is used at runtime.

### Why should I use it?
You maintain a software for many customers; they all use a different stack of
tech in their infrastructure. To handle this you have to write a core software
and many folks of this core to adjust the software to the specific stack of your
customer. To avoid this infinity loop of adjusting, this very lightweight framework was
built. With dhs you can define your software independently of your customers
specifications - whilst you're avoiding boilerplate code!
